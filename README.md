# latin-ecclesiatic-accents

This repository contains resources for ecclesiastic accentuation.

The goal is to have some documentation about accentuation for prose, and a corpus of accentuated hymns, as these cannot be accented automatically.


## Resources

- [doc/accentuation-rules.md](doc/accentuation-rules.md) contains the rules for accentuating prose
- [corpus/](corpus) contains a corpus of accentuated texts


## Bibliography

- *Te Decet Hymnus* by Anselmo Lentini, 1984, which is the primary and official source for post-Vatican II hymns
- *The Hymns of the Breviary and Missal* by Matthew Britt, 1922, availble on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/HymnsOfTheBreviaryAndMissal)
