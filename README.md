# latin-ecclesiastic-accents

This repository contains resources for ecclesiastic accentuation.

The goal is to have some documentation about accentuation for prose, and a corpus of accentuated hymns, as these cannot be accented automatically.


## Resources

- [doc/accentuation-rules.md](doc/accentuation-rules.md) contains the rules for accentuating prose.
- [corpus/](corpus) contains a corpus of accentuated texts.
- [accenteur/](https://github.com/BrRoman/accenteur/tree/91823fe07b269189e8c0dd87a39caefdc1052c7d): a simple Javascript webpage to automatically accentuate latin texts ([demo here](https://brroman.github.io/accenteur/)).


## Bibliography and links

- *The Hymns of the Breviary and Missal* by Matthew Britt, 1922, availble on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/HymnsOfTheBreviaryAndMissal)
